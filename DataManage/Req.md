I want to build a webpage on Data Management, with a Study Notes section and an Interactive Data Analysis section. 

The Study Notes page will serve as a comprehensive reference, covering topics like central tendency (mean, median, mode), data spread (range, IQR, standard deviation), visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots), line of best fit, correlation, and real-world examples, with interactive features like expandable sections, pop-up explanations, and mini-quizzes. 

The Data Analysis section will allow users to input data manually, calculate central tendency and spread, highlight outliers, generate visualizations, box plots, create scatter plots with lines of best fit, display correlation coefficients, positive correlation, negative correlation and no correlation and offer comparative analysis between two datasets. Additionally, the Data analysis section should also allow for users to randomly generate data to be calculated and analyzed.
